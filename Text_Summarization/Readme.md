# Text Summarization with Multiple Models

## Overview  
This project implements and compares various **text summarization models**, including **abstractive** and **extractive** approaches.  
It utilizes **Hugging Face's Transformers**, the **Sumy** library, and **AllenAI's PRIMERA** model to generate summaries and evaluate their effectiveness.  

## Models Used  

### 1Ô∏è. facebook/bart-large-cnn (Abstractive Summarization)  
- Extracts key information from the input text.  
- Tends to use the **first few sentences** as a summary.  

### 2Ô∏è. google/pegasus-xsum (Abstractive Summarization)  
- Provides a **headline-style summary**, capturing the **gist** of the text.  
- More effective for concise summarization.  

### 3Ô∏è. Sumy (Extractive Summarization - LexRank Algorithm)  
- Selects and concatenates key sentences from the input text.  
- Does not generate new sentences but extracts important ones.  

### 4Ô∏è. allenai/PRIMERA (Abstractive Summarization for Long Texts)  
- Designed for **long-form document summarization**.  
- Uses **transformers** to create coherent summaries.

## Model Comparison  

| Model                        | Type         | Summary Style                          | Strengths  | Weaknesses  |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)**  | Abstractive | Extracts key sentences | Good for document summarization | May rely on first few sentences |
| **Pegasus (google/pegasus-xsum)**   | Abstractive | Headline-style, concise | Captures gist well | May lose finer details |
| **Sumy (LexRank Algorithm)**        | Extractive  | Concatenates key sentences | Simple and fast | Not truly abstractive |
| **PRIMERA (allenai/PRIMERA)**       | Abstractive | Summarizes long texts | Handles complex documents | Requires more computation |
